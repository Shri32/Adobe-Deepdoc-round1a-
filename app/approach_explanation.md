## Approach Explanation – Round 1B

### Objective

To process a collection of PDF documents and produce a structured JSON summary based on a given persona and job-to-be-done. The output includes metadata, extracted sections ranked by importance, and a refined analysis of specific sub-sections — all under strict runtime and memory constraints.

### Methodology

1. *PDF Text Extraction*
   - We use `PyMuPDF` for fast and efficient text extraction, processing each page and capturing its contents.
   - All extracted text is stored along with page numbers to maintain traceability.

2. *Section Identification*
   - A pattern-matching engine (`pattern_engine.py`) scans text for key headings based on common academic or business report structures.
   - Sections like “Results”, “Conclusion”, “Methodology”, and “Future Work” are marked as high importance.
   - Optionally, suggested sections such as “Limitations” or “Ethical Considerations” are highlighted to help users go beyond surface-level content.

3. *Summary Generation*
   - For each important section, we trim or condense the text to a defined character limit (e.g., 1500 characters) to ensure clarity and brevity.
   - Extracted content is refined using simple text-cleaning logic and placeholder summarization. (More advanced NLP could be slotted in if allowed.)

4. *Metadata Handling*
   - Persona, job-to-be-done, and document list are embedded in the output metadata, along with a processing timestamp for reproducibility.

### Compliance with Constraints

- ✅ *CPU-Only Execution:* No GPU dependencies or frameworks.
- ✅ *Model Size < 1GB:* No large model used; pure rule-based pattern extraction and summarization.
- ✅ *<60 seconds runtime:* Efficient parsing ensures performance across 3–5 documents.
- ✅ *No Internet Access:* All processing is self-contained.

### Future Scope

- Integration of lightweight transformer-based summarization (if permitted).
- Fine-tuned ranking of sections based on tf-idf or semantic relevance.
- Enhanced suggestion of missing but useful sections based on persona intent.
